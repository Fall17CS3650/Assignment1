# Login to NEU server

ssh is a protocol that allws you to login and access resources remotely. 

If you are running on a linux or mac,  you can use ssh through the terminal. If you are on Windows, I recommend downloading a program called Putty.

ssh yourname@login.ccs.neu.edu (where yourname is your ccis account)

# Creating a github account:

GitHub(www.github.com) is an online webpage that hosts git respositories. GitHub.com is a place that will host your code online where you can make incremental changes to. Your code will be saved online, and you can then download the repository from anywhere!

1. Log onto https://github.com
2. Create a new account
3. Accept the invitation to this assignment by clicking the assignment on the course page or on this link: https://classroom.github.com/a/41YYMJn-

# Get practice using github 

Practice using git (the version control program that uploads your code to github.com) through the following tutorial:

https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1



Tasks:

    Run the command "less /course/cs3650/help/unix-help.txt" and read the help file. The "q" key quits.
    Run "mkdir -p ~/cs3650/hw01".
    Run "ps -ef" and redirect the output to a file in your new hw01 directory.
    Create a gzipped tarball of the hw01 directory (containing exactly the hw01 directory and the ps output file).
    Copy that tarball to your local machine. (Linux: scp command; Mac: Cyberduck?; Windows: WinSCP)
    Submit the tarball here.
    Finally, run the "touch" command to create a file in /course/cs3650sp17/hw01 named [your-user-name].txt
